# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Real World Machine Learning projects inspired by the need to create.
Project 06: Credit card fraud detection.
Industry: Fintech, App Security, E-Commerce

## Description

Conventional card fraud detection systems are almost always rule based.
From experiance we can agree that these systems are quickly becoming weaker
against crooks. A rule could be as simple as the most generic question you can
think about.

Giving a personal verdict, a rule based system is only as efficient as
the complexity of it's rules.

With advances in computing technology, it has become neccesary to come
up with better techniques to detect fraud to keep up with the ever evolving
skills of these crooks.

We will eploy both machine and deep learning to attempt and solve this problem.

## Getting Started

We will be using using a publicly available dataset of financial data that
has been conveniently anonymized for us.

Our duty is tell apart fraudulent transactions from genuine ones and
investigate anomalies in the data to better detect and prevent
unauthorized transactions.

In short, we are looking for unusual patterns.

It is estimated that only 0.1% of all transactions are fraudulent.
Given the volume of transactions, this informs us that our model needs to
be highly accurate in order to spot these underlying patterns that we are looking for.

As usual, we will take only what we need and discard the rest.
Let's begin.
