# Predicting Likelihood of a user E-Signing/Requesting a Loan

Real World Machine Learning projects inspired by the need to create.
Project 05: Predicting the Likelihood of a user E-Signing a Loan Based on Financial History
Industry: Fintech


## Description

Lending companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants,
and choosing whether or not the applicant is too risky to be offered a loan based on a
risk factor.

An example of this is the credit score system used by the US.
Companies acquire these potential applicants through their website, apps
or advertising campaigns.

We are going to asses the quality or these leads/applicants to determine their risk factors
for our employer.

## Getting Started

The product itself is a loan, but that isn't what we are concerned about.

Our job is to develop a model that can identify 'quality' applicants which are
good candidates for our loaning service.

Definition of quality depends on your requirements(interests of your employer) ie: a user you may consider as a
quality applicant based on your dataset.

In our case study specifications, quality applicants are those who reach
a certain key part of the loan application process.

To be more specific, users that are able to complete the electronic signature
phase of the application process.


TLDR: We try to answer the question: Will this user apply for a loan from us?.
