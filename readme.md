# Real World Machine Learning

Real World Machine Learning projects inspired by the need to create, the curiousity to learn and personal goals.
If you're like me, you have most certainly found yourself with a Machine Learning/Data Science case study or interview
question that either you could not or did not adequately prepare for, could not finish on time or you outright didin't have the required skillset.

That's what this repo is all about, reference when you find yourself stuck with a problem.
Chances are, the solution or a variant of it exists in this repo.

There's a little data analysis embedded in almost every project.
Knock yourself out.


## Getting Started

* How do I adapt this to my project?

  * Choice 1:
    First take a look at the dataset being used in your project of choice, then try
    to adapt your own dataset to look like the example used in the project.
    For best performance, it has to be a similar usecase to the one used in the example.

  * Choice 2(Advanced):
    You can avoid editing your dataset by adapting the code to fit it instead.
    This requires more experience to do, and probaly your best bet.

  * A footnote:
    For the projects that have more than one script make sure you run the pre-processing code
    before you attempt running the model.
    This is because the model makes use of files that are created by the data preprocessing.

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* Python 3(required).
* All other dependencies can be found at the top of every script.
  Otherwise your python interpreter...conda, jupyter,
  ipython etc will just display a module not found error.
  Make sure you install all the depencies before you attempt running the script.

  Will include a lockfile later to address dependency version conflicts.


### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program
