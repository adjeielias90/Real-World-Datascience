# Breast Cancer classification

Real World Machine Learning projects inspired by the need to create.
Project 02

## Description

A deep learning model that identifies and classifies the attire of a subject.
The model can look at images and can tell us exactly what category in that image.
The global fashion industry is valued at three trillion dollars and accounts for 2 percent of the world's total GDP
Our shiny new model can help fashion(or whatever applications) retailers to detect and forecast fashion trends and launch targeted marketing campaigns.
