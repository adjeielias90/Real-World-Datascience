# Fashion classifier

Real World Machine Learning projects inspired by the need to create.
Project 02

## Description

A deep learning model that identifies and classifies the attire of a subject.
The model can look at images and can tell us exactly what category in that image.
The global fashion industry is valued at three trillion dollars and accounts for 2 percent of the world's total GDP.

Our little shiny new model can help fashion(or whatever applications) retailers to detect and forecast trends and launch targeted marketing campaigns.

## Getting Started

The MNIST Fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

The 10 classes are as follows:
0 => T-shirt/top 1 => Trouser 2 => Pullover 3 => Dress 4 => Coat 5 => Sandal 6 => Shirt 7 => Sneaker 8 => Bag 9 => Ankle boot

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.

Let's get started.
